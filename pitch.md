WHAT is Sprout?
Sprout is a trustless peer-to-peer payment app that lets anyone create a secure payment link with built-in protection against scams. There are no accounts, no KYC, and no middlemen. Just simple, safe payments that work anywhere.
WHY is Sprout Needed?
Traditional platforms (PayPal, Stripe, banks) require accounts, identity verification, and high fees.
Crypto payments are instant but risky because they are irreversible and offer no safety net.
Freelancers, small merchants, enterprises, and individuals need a way to transact securely with new or unverified parties.
There is a major gap for a privacy-first, anti-KYC, escrow-like system that keeps transactions safe while staying simple.
HOW does Sprout Work?
For the sender:
Create a payment link inside Sprout.
Enter amount, token, and receiver address.
Add custom contract conditions if needed.
Optionally enable dispute resolution with a neutral arbitrator.
Share the unique payment link with the receiver.

For the receiver:
Open the link and review payment details.
Accept terms and confirm.
Funds are locked in a smart contract escrow.
Once conditions are met, the receiver claims the funds.
If a conflict arises, dispute resolution can be triggered.

Tech foundation:
Yellow SDK provides the secure wallet interaction layer, decentralized messaging, and link-based payment flow.
ERC-7824 standard enables programmable escrow contracts with modular conditions and dispute resolution baked in.
WHO is Sprout for?
Freelancers and remote workers who need guaranteed payment from new clients.
Small merchants and service providers who want simple, low-cost, secure transactions.
Enterprises that need scalable, transparent, and trustless payment rails for cross-border contracts or vendor agreements.
Everyday crypto users sending money securely without trusting strangers.
Communities and DAOs that need transparent and safe ways to handle group payments.
WHY Sprout NOW?
The freelance economy and cross-border work are growing rapidly, but trust in online payments is low.
Web3 adoption is increasing, but scams and failed trust limit usage.
Enterprises are seeking compliance-light, borderless payment systems that reduce friction.
Users everywhere want anti-KYC, privacy-first tools that still give them confidence their funds are safe.
Sprout solves all of these by combining crypto simplicity, escrow protection, and total privacy.



Sprout is proudly built on the ERC-7824 protocol by Yellow Network:
ERC-7824 enables contracts that hold funds securely, release them only when agreed conditions are met, and allow modular dispute resolution if something goes wrong. This makes every Sprout payment link a mini escrow system, embedded directly on-chain, fully auditable, and tamper-proof.

Yellow SDK powers the user-facing layer with secure wallet interactions, decentralized messaging, and link-based flows. Instead of forcing users to create accounts or share identity data, Yellow SDK lets Sprout handle everything trustlessly; the sender generates a payment link, the receiver opens it, and both interact seamlessly with the underlying escrow contract.

Together, ERC-7824 and Yellow SDK transform what used to be risky, one-way crypto transfers into programmable, enforceable agreements. This is the foundation that makes Sprout both radically simple for users and rock-solid in terms of security.
